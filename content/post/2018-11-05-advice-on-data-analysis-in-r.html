<p>While on my visit to the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, I had the pleasure of taking over <a href="https://chrischizinski.github.io/">Chris Chizinski’s</a> R class on Friday (2018-11-02).</p>
<p>I demo’d a few things about setting up RStudio, using RStudio packages and the <code>here</code> package, and then walked through a workflow of doing data analysis, converting code into functions, and writing scripts and functions to be more accessible for readers.</p>
<p>For reference, here are <a href="/slides/2018-11-02_UNLSNR-R-class_slides.html">my slides</a>.</p>
