While on my visit to the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, I had the pleasure of taking over [Chris Chizinski's](https://chrischizinski.github.io/) R class on Friday (2018-11-02).

I demo'd a few things about setting up RStudio, using RStudio packages and the `here` package, and then walked through a workflow of doing data analysis, converting code into functions, and writing scripts and functions to be more accessible for readers.

For reference, here are [my slides](/slides/2018-11-02_UNLSNR-R-class_slides.html).
