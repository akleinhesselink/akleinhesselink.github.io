<p>For my <a href="https://github.com/ha0ye/rEDM">rEDM</a> package, I’ve been using the <code>pkgdown</code> package to build a <a href="https://ha0ye.github.io/rEDM/">website</a> comprising all the documentation and vignettes, for easy reference from a web browser.</p>
<p>The normal workflow for this is something like:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Make updates to the package.</li>
<li>Run <code>pkgdown::build_site()</code> to generate the website files into a <code>docs</code> folder.</li>
<li>Commit changes and upload to GitHub.</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, configured to source the files from the <code>docs</code> folder on the master branch.</li>
</ol>
<p>But we’re programmers, so why can’t we automate the steps of 2-4? Luckily, there is a <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/continuous-deployment-of-package-documentation-with-pkgdown-and-travis-ci/">guide</a> for this already.</p>
<p>One issue that I ran into is that some of the documentation is built using the current package, which isn’t installed by default in the Travis CI instance. (i.e. when Travis runs through the <code>R CMD CHECK</code>, it installs the package temporarily, but that does not stick around) Thus, I ran into errors when <code>pkgdown</code> tried to compile my <code>README.Rmd</code>, which contained an example of using the package, as well as the vignettes.</p>
<p>My solution to this was simple, include a line before running <code>pkgdown::build_site()</code> that installs the package. I ended up with this following segment of my <code>.travis.yml</code> file:</p>
<pre><code>after_success:
  - R CMD INSTALL .
  - Rscript -e &#39;pkgdown::build_site()&#39;</code></pre>
<p>and after changing over my GitHub Pages setting to look in the <code>gh-pages</code> branch, everything was set!</p>
