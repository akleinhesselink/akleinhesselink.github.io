One of the classical perspectives for stability in ecology is through studying the species interaction matrix. Using [empirical dynamic modeling](/project/empirical-dynamic-modeling/), it is possible to infer the interaction matrix as a dynamic quantity that changes over time. This then allows for estimation of stability as a changing quantity.

This approach, "dynamic stability", is described and demonstrated for a fish community in Maizuru Bay in [Ushio et al. 2018](/publication/2018_maizuru-dynamic-stability/).

An ongoing project tests whether dynamic stability can be a useful guide for identifying abrupt shifts in ecological communities. Specifically, we are looking at community change in rodents at the Portal experimental site, and validating the method against the shifts identified in [Christensen et al. 2018](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecy.2373).

Code and data for this project are available in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ha0ye/portal-DS) and initial results were presented at the 2018 ESA meeting in New Orleans.
