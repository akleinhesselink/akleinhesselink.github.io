Forecasting is, in essence, predicting the future. When developing forecast models in ecology, the models are typically validated by performance on past observations. Sometimes forecasting is the primary goal, and our objective is to come up with the most plausible / reliable model. Othertimes we may be interested in understanding particular aspects of the system (e.g. is temperature a factor for fish populations?), with forecast skill used as a metric to answer the question (e.g. do the models that include temperature produce better forecasts than models that do not?).
