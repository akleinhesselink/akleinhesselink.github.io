The science of ecology should play a central role in informing our decisions about how to manage the environment. However, this statement glosses over the fact that the understanding provided by science always comes with a degree of uncertainty and that there are often competing answers to any question.  What then is the best way for ecologists to *demonstrate* the degree of uncertainty in our understanding? And what is the best way to ejudicate competing claims of ecological understanding in the literature? 

Some ecologists are increasingly arguing that the most persuasive demonstration of ecological understanding is to make and test predictions.

Peter Adler and I took a crack at making ecological predictions in a drought-shelter and irrigation experiment in the sagebrush steppe of eastern Idaho.  

We used several decades worth of data to build population models for the dominant plant species in this community.  By fitting regression for each each species growth in response to annual temperature variation we developed a statistical model that should, in theory, predict how those species would respond to climate in the future.  

We could have waited several decades for the climate to continue changing in order to test these predicitons.  But that would take... several decades.  

As a shortcut we used a drought shelter and irrigation experiment in the field to test whether species' responses to historical climate variation could predict species contemporary response to short-term experimentally imposed drought and irrigation.  

Our resuls show that...
