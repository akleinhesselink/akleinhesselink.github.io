What  is the best way for ecologists to *demonstrate* our understanding of nature? 
 
Ecologists often make assertions about how well their theories work, but they rarely rigorously test their theories by making predictions. The error between what we predict will hapen and what actually does happen is perhaps the most honest measure of how much more we have to learn about any biological system.  

My advisor at Utah State University and I used long-term data to fit climate driven population models for four species of perennial plant in the sagebrush steppe of eastern Idaho. We then generated predictions for how each of the four species would respond in novel conditions--either a 50% increase in spring and summer precipitation or a 50% decrease. We imposed these conditions experimentally on natural plant communities with drought shelters and paired irrigation plots. We collected data on the populations in the plots for five years to validate our predictions.
