A number of projects that I've worked on have used forecasting as a guide for model selection - where processes and mechanisms are inferred from the models with better forecast skill. Still other projects have focused solely on forecasting future states of systems as a singular goal.

Example papers:

* [Kilcik et al. 2009 "Nonlinear prediction of solar cycle 24"](/publication/2009_solar-cycle-prediction/)
* [Glaser et al. 2011 "Detecting and forecasting complex nonlinear dynamics in spatially structured catch-per-unit-effort time series for North Pacific albacore (Thunnus alalunga)"](/publication/2011_spatial-forecasts/)
* [Glaser et al. 2013 "A nonlinear, low data requirement model for producing spatially explicit fishery forecasts"](/publication/2013_spatial-forecasts/)
* [Ye et al. 2015 "Equation-free mechanistic ecosystem forecasting using empirical dynamic modeling"](/publication/2015_equation-free-modeling/)
* [Ye et al. 2015 "Predicting the future in a bonlinear world"](/publication/2015_nonlinear-prediction/)
* [McGowan et al. 2017 "Predicting coastal algal blooms in southern California"](/publication/2017_predicting-algal-blooms/)
* [Deyle et al. 2018 "Ecosystem‚Äêbased forecasts of recruitment in two menhaden species"](/publication/2018_menhaden-forecasts/)
* [Pennekamp et al. 2018 "The intrinsic predictability of ecological time series and its potential to guide forecasting"](publication/2018_intrinsic-predictability/)
