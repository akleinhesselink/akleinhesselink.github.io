rEDM is an R package for empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), an approach for understanding the inherent dynamics (i.e. rules, processes, mechanisms) that underlie time series observations.

The approach relies on the theory of attractor reconstruction (also referred to as "state-space reconstruction" or "time-delay embedding") to transform time series into approximations of the original dynamic system that the time series are observations of. This has applications for [forecasting](/project/forecasting/), [causal inference](/project/causality/), and more.

The package is available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rEDM), but more recent updates will be found on the [GitHub](https://github.com/ha0ye/rEDM) page for the project.
