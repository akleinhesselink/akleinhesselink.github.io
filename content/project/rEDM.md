[Empirical Dynamic Modeling](/project/empirical-dynamic-modeling/)(EDM) is an approach for inferring the dynamics (rules/processes/mechanisms) of underlying systems from time series observations. [rEDM](https://github.com/ha0ye/rEDM) is an R package for performing different aspects of EDM (please see the [EDM project page](/project/empirical-dynamic-modeling/) for more info).

It is also available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rEDM), though the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ha0ye/rEDM) always contains the most up-to-date code and documentation.

**Current Status: Prepping tutorial vignette for MEE submission.**
