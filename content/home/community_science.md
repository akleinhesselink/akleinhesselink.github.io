Community science projects such as [iNaturalist](www.inaturalist.org) and [eBird](www.ebird.org) offer incredible new opportunities to monitor the biodiversity around us in real time. Perhaps more importantly, these projects connect naturalists from around the globe and inspire them to explore biodiversity in greater depth. Professional ecologists and environmental scientists have only just begun to take advantage of these data--for example see this paper from the LA County Natural History museum: [Li et al. (2019) _Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution_](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2019.00277/full). 


### Contributions to iNaturalist

Since participating in a [Bioblitz of the Amargosa River](https://www.scienceforconservation.org/products/amargosa-bioblitz-2017) organized by the Nature Conservancy in 2017, I have become an enthusiastic promoter of iNaturalist. 

- I have contributed nearly 4000 observations, mostly from the Los Angeles area [(link to iNat profile)](https://www.inaturalist.org/people/andy71). 
- I created the [UCLA Biodiversity Project](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/ucla-campus-biodiversity) to collect observations of nature from the UCLA campus. So far we have documented over 1400 species on campus! 
- February 2019, I led two workshops at the UCLA Mildred Mathias Botanical Garden to help students and community members get started with iNaturalist. 
- November 2019, I gave a presentation about how iNaturalist could transform research in ecology and evolution to UCLA graduate students. 
- August 2018, I met up with other iNaturalist users at the annual Ecological Society of America meeting in New Orleans:  [iNat mixer 2018](https://www.inaturalist.org/journal/carrieseltzer/18119-the-first-esa-inaturalist-mixer).
- I am working on expanding and updating the [__rinat__  package for R](https://github.com/akleinhesselink/rinat) which makes accessing iNaturalist data easier for researchers. 
- I have contributed to the annual [City Nature Challenge](http://citynaturechallenge.org/) in Los Angeles and Southern Oregon.
- I Regularly participate in the online iNaturalist discussion [forum](https://forum.inaturalist.org/). 


### UCLA Bruin Naturalist Club 

I am a trip leader and adviser for the [Bruin Naturalist Club](https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/project/bruin-naturalists-club) which provides undergraduates of all majors at UCLA opportunities to explore nature in Southern California. In each of these trips we introduce students to iNaturalist and show them how to document the plants and animals they find. Recently I've helped with inlcude:

- 11/15/19 Corn Springs and the Salton Sea. 
- 05/25/19 [UCLA Stunt Ranch Bioblitz](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/bnc-bioblitz-at-stunt-ranch-spring-2019). 
- 02/24/19 [UCSB Sedgwick Reserve](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/sedgwick-biodiversity) 
- 01/20/19 BNC Trip to tidepools of Palos Verdes with Regina Wetzer, Kathy Omura and Dean Pentcheff of the LA County Natural History Museum. 
 
### eBird and Birding

I got hooked on birding at the Point Reyes Christmas Bird Count in 2005.  Since then I have contributed hundreds of checklists to [eBird (link to profile)](https://ebird.org/profile/MTM5OTI2/US-CA-037). At UCLA, I have made a concerted effort to document the birds on campus and in the Botanical Garden in particular. I helped Samuel Bressler start the UCLA Bruin Audubon Society and Birdwatching club [(featured in the Daily Bruin)](https://dailybruin.com/2019/11/15/bruin-audubon-society-and-birding-club-makes-bird-watching-a-hoot-for-students/).  And I lead weekly [birdwatching trips on campus](https://www.botgard.ucla.edu/event/bruin-birding-club-fall-migration-garden-walks-5/) and regular weekend trips to hotspots around Southern California.
