Community science databases such as [iNaturalist](www.inaturalist.org) and [eBird](www.ebird.org) offer incredible new opportunities to monitor biodiversity and observe how it is changing around us in real time. Just as importantly, these projects inspire curiosity and engage the broader community outside of academia. I am excited to work to increase participation in these community science projects and the use of the data they generate by research ecologists and environmental scientists.

### Contributions to iNaturalist and eBird 

I am an enthusiastic contributor to both iNaturalist [(link to iNaturalist profile)](https://www.inaturalist.org/people/andy71) and eBird [(link to profile)](https://ebird.org/profile/MTM5OTI2/US-CA-037).  I created the [UCLA Biodiversity Project](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/ucla-campus-biodiversity) to collect observations of nature from the UCLA campus.  So far we have documented over 1400 species on campus! 

### UCLA Audubon Society 

I lead weekly [birdwatching field trips on campus](https://www.botgard.ucla.edu/event/bruin-birding-club-fall-migration-garden-walks-5/) for the UCLA Bruin Audubon Society (recently [featured in the Daily Bruin](https://dailybruin.com/2019/11/15/bruin-audubon-society-and-birding-club-makes-bird-watching-a-hoot-for-students/)) and I help lead occasional weekend field trips to birding hotspots around Southern California. 

### UCLA Bruin Naturalist Club 

I am a trip leader and advisor for the [Bruin Naturalist Club](https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/project/bruin-naturalists-club) which provides undergraduates of all majors at UCLA opportunities to explore nature in Southern Calfornia.  Recent trips I've led include explorations of UC Sedgwick Reserve in Santa Barbara, tidepools on the Palos Verdes Peninsula and the Sonoran desert in Imperial County.
