### UCLA IoES Capstone Advisor

I am currently a faculty advisor for the [IoES senior practicum](https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/envisci/senior-practicum/) at UCLA. The practicum gives undergraduates a chance to engage in meaningful research aimed at solving real world environmental issues. This winter and spring I am working with seven highly motivated undergraduates in evaluating native seed sources and restoration opportunities in the Los Angeles Basin. 

### Software Carpentry

I am trained instructor for [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/). In spring of 20218, I led a Software Carpentry workshop for the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department at UCLA [UCLA  EEB 2018-4-7](https://ucla-data-archive.github.io/2018-04-07-ucla-eeb/). Our workshop focused on teaching the basics of the [unix shell](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/), [git and github](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) for coding collaboration and [R](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/) for data analysis, data visualization and GIS.

### Environmental Education 

I have a deep commitment to teaching ecology and natural history to the general public and to K-12 students. From 2009 to 2010 I volunteered as Vice President and led environmental education and birdwatching field trips for elementary school students for [San Francisco Nature Education](http://sfnature.org/). While working in the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy I served as a mentor for the [LINC Program](https://www.parksconservancy.org/programs/linc-summer-high-school-program) which provides summer-long work and education experiences for highschool students within Golden Gate National Recreation Area. 

I lead weekly [birdwatching field trips on campus](https://www.botgard.ucla.edu/event/bruin-birding-club-fall-migration-garden-walks-5/) for the UCLA Bruin Audubon Society (recently [featured in the Daily Bruin](https://dailybruin.com/2019/11/15/bruin-audubon-society-and-birding-club-makes-bird-watching-a-hoot-for-students/)).  I also have been involved as a board member and trip leader for the UCLA Bruin Naturalist Club. 

### Undergraduate Mentoring

Throughout my career I have mentored many exceptional undergraduate research projects. I am currently working with a talented undergraduate at UCLA on a study of annual plant functional ecology and how increased night time temperatures may affect the growth rates of annual plants native to coastal California grasslands. 

One of the highlights of my career was working with undergraduates at Utah State University during my PhD. One of my undergraduate mentees, Nicole Pendleton, was an author on a recent paper from the Adler lab on how ['snow-molds' (subniveal fungal pathogens) affect cheatgrass population growth rates](https://academic.oup.com/aobpla/article/11/5/plz043/5532809). Her experiments as a summer REU ended up being instrumental to showing snowmold was a likely cause of higher cheatgrass mortality in heavy snowpacks. 

### Undergraduate Biology

While a M.S. student, I taught lab sections for Biol. 110: “Biological Inquiry” and Biol. 121: “Diversity Structure and Function” for the [Department of Biology at Sonoma State University](http://biology.sonoma.edu/).
