At UCLA, my postdoctoral research has focused on two main projects:

1. Providing a general definition for higher order interactions (HOIs) and in testing for their strength in natural ecosystems. [biorXiv Preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/857920v1)
2. Building on previous work in the Kraft lab [Kraft et al. 2015](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/3/797.short) I am working to develop a more general understanding of how plant functional traits influence community composition and competition between species. 

The links below provide more details about these and other ongoing projects.
