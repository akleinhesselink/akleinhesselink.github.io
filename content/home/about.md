# Biography

I'm a Postdoctoral Associate in the [Kraft Lab](https://sites.lifesci.ucla.edu/eeb-kraft/) at UCLA. My focus is on coexistence and using population models to predict species response to global change. 

I believe that the best way ecologists can demonstrate ecological understanding is to make successful ecological predictions and [forecasts](https://ecoforecast.org/book/). 

A focus on what ecologists can predict repeatedly and with confidence will breathe fresh life into research areas where theory has outpaced our ability to test it.  

* Can we predict species short-term response to climate change?
* Can we predict species coexistence? 
* Is it possible to restore ecosystem stability or just ecosystem states? 
* Do statistical descriptions of ecological states give us information on ecological dynamics or stability? 

As an early career ecologists, I'm also excited about the rise of new technology for improving data collection in the field such as machine vision. 

I'm also excited about the rapid growth of new citizen science datasets such as [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/) and [eBird](https://www.ebird.org). These continuously evolving datasets present ecologists with the ideal opportunity to make and test ecological predictions.
