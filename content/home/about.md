# Biography

I'm a Postdoctoral Associate in the [Kraft Lab](https://sites.lifesci.ucla.edu/eeb-kraft/) at UCLA. 

My postdoctoral research focused has focused on two main areas:

1. Providing a general definition for higher order interactions (HOIs) and in testing for their strength in natural ecosystems. [biorXiv Preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/857920v1)
2. Building on previous work in the Kraft lab [Kraft et al. 2015](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/3/797.short) I am working to develop a more general understanding of how plant functional traits influence community composition and competition between species.
