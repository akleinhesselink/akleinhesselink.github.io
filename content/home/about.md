# Biography

I am a Postdoctoral Associate and Moore Data Fellow in the [Weecology Lab](weecology.org) at the University of Florida. I study how natural ecosystems persist and change over time.

My research consists of developing new methods for analyzing time series data, testing them on real observations, and using them to answer questions about the generality of dynamic behaviors. For example, I am interested in quantifying the speed and form of ecosystem change (i.e. stability / resilience); how changes manifest across temporal, spatial, and taxonomic scales; and ultimately, constructing causal models that can guide forecasts and management.
