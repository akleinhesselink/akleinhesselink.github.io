# Biography

I'm a Postdoctoral Associate in the [Kraft Lab](https://sites.lifesci.ucla.edu/eeb-kraft/) at UCLA.

Ecologists can now collect orders of magnitude more data than they could just a few decades ago and ecologists have turned to increasingly complex statistics to make sense of all this data.  But has this made a difference in how well we actually *understand* ecological communities? 

If it has, how can ecologists *demonstrate* that our research has improved our understanding of what goes on in nature? 

As an early career ecologists I am excited by a new emphasis on prediction and [forecasting](https://ecoforecast.org/book/) as a means of demonstrating ecological understanding. A focus on what ecologists can repeatedly predict with confidence in ecological communities can breathe fresh life into research areas where theory has outpaced our ability to test it.  

* Can we predict species short-term response to climate change?
* Can we predict species coexistence? 
* Is it possible to restore ecosystem stability or just ecosystem states? 
* Do statistical descriptions of ecological states give us information on ecological dynamics or stability? 

I believe these questions go beyond academic interest.  In order to manage ecosystems and conserve species in the face of climate change, and in order to undue decades of damage through the ecological restoration, we need to focus on developing ecological theory that is general and predictive. 

I'm also excited about the rapid growth of new citizen science datasets such as [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/) and [eBird](https://www.ebird.org) as ways to test our ability to test our ecological predictions.
