# Biography

I am a Postdoctoral Associate and Moore Data Fellow in the [Weecology Lab](weecology.org) at the University of Florida. My research focuses on using empirical data to understand how ecosystems persist and change over time.

My research consists of two main components.
1. I work on methods to analyze time series data and infer mechanisms and dynamical behavior.
2. I apply these methods to data, mainly from ecosystems, to test hypotheses, infer causal relationships, and forecast future behavior.
